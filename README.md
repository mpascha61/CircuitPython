## Hello_CircuitPython

### Description & Code
Description goes here

Here's how you make code look like code:

```python
Code goes here
import board
import neopixel
import time

dot = neopixel.NeoPixel(board.NEOPIXEL, 1)
print("Make it red!")

while True:
    dot.fill((0, 0, 255))
    time.sleep(.30)
    dot.fill((153, 0, 255))
    time.sleep(.30)
    dot.fill((255, 0, 0))
    time.sleep(.30)
```

### Evidence
Pictures / Gifs of your work should go here

### Images
Make an account with your google ID at [tinkercad.com](https://www.tinkercad.com/learn/circuits), and use "TinkerCad Circuits to make a wiring diagram."  It's really easy!  
Then post an image here.   [here's a quick tutorial for all markdown code, like making links](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)

### Reflection


Changing the code to swtich colors and timing was fairly simple but I had issues with the actual neopixel download not being in my student drive.




## CircuitPython_Servo

### Description & Code

```python
Code goes here
"""CircuitPython Essentials Servo standard servo example"""
import time
import board
import pwmio
import servo

# create a PWMOut object on Pin A2.
pwm = pwmio.PWMOut(board.A2, duty_cycle=2 ** 15, frequency=50)

# Create a servo object, my_servo.
my_servo = servo.Servo(pwm)

while True:
    for angle in range(0, 180, 1):  # 0 - 180 degrees, 5 degrees at a time.
        my_servo.angle = angle
        time.sleep(0.01)
    for angle in range(180, 0, -1): # 180 - 0 degrees, 5 degrees at a time.
        my_servo.angle = angle
        time.sleep(0.01)

```

### Reflection
Somewhat simple except I had to remove the code telling it to input the adafruit servo from the adafruit file because I had already moved the file to my D drive (metro drive).
